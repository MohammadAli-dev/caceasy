FIX REPORT 2 (AFTER)
====================
Date: 2025-11-24

1. ADMIN PACKAGE
   Test File: packages/admin/src/__tests__/Analytics.test.tsx
   
   Error Found: 
   - Tests failed because they could not find elements with data-testid attributes (kpi-scans, etc.).
   - The component packages/admin/src/pages/analytics.tsx was missing these attributes.

   Fix Attempted:
   - Modified packages/admin/src/pages/analytics.tsx.
   - Added data-testid="kpi-scans", "kpi-active-masons", "kpi-redemption-rate", "kpi-pending-payouts" to the corresponding <p> elements.

   Result: PASSED
   - Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
   - Tests: 4 passed, 4 total

2. DEALER PACKAGE
   Test File: packages/dealer/src/__tests__/index.test.tsx

   Error Found:
   - Test suite failed to run with error: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'use')" at Object.interceptors (utils/api.ts:13:5).
   - This was caused by the simple jest.mock('axios') returning undefined for axios.create(), causing the api instance in utils/api.ts to be undefined/malformed.

   Fix Attempted:
   - Modified packages/dealer/__tests__/index.test.tsx.
   - Replaced jest.mock('axios') with a comprehensive mock factory that returns a mock object for axios.create(), including the required interceptors object.

   Result: PASSED
   - Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
   - Tests: 1 passed, 1 total

SUMMARY
=======
Both test suites are now PASSING.
- Admin Analytics tests: OK
- Dealer Index tests: OK
